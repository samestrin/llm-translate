## 1. Paper Component

### 1.1. Overview
The `Paper` component is a container for displaying content on an elevated surface. In Material Design, surface components and shadow styles are heavily influenced by their real-world physical counterparts. Material UI implements this concept with the `Paper` component, a container-like surface that features the `elevation` prop for pulling box-shadow values from the theme.

### 1.2. Import Statement
```jsx
import Paper from '@mui/material/Paper';
```

### 1.3. Basic Usage
```jsx
export default function SimplePaper() {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexWrap: 'wrap',
        '& > :not(style)': {
          m: 1,
          width: 128,
          height: 128,
        },
      }}
    >
      <Paper elevation={3}>
        <Typography variant="h5" component="h3" sx={{ p: 2 }}>
          This is a sheet of paper.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component="p" sx={{ p: 2 }}>
          Paper can be used to build surface or container elements.
        </Typography>
      </Paper>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### 1.4. Component Variants
The `Paper` component has different variants controlled by the `variant` prop. The default variant is `'elevation'`, which applies shadow based on the `elevation` prop. Another variant is `'outlined'`, which renders a flat, outlined `Paper` with no shadows.

### 1.5. Key Props
| Prop | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `children` | `node` |  | Yes | The content of the component. |
| `classes` | `object` |  | No | Override or extend the styles applied to the component. |
| `component` | `elementType` | `div` | No | The component used for the root node. |
| `elevation` | `number` | `1` | No | Shadow depth, corresponds to `dp` in Material Design. |
| `square` | `bool` | `false` | No | If `true`, rounded corners are disabled. |
| `sx` | `Array<func | object | bool> | func | object` |  | No | The system prop that allows defining system overrides as well as additional CSS styles. |
| `variant` | `'elevation' | 'outlined'` | `'elevation'` | No | The variant to use. |

### 1.6. Common Patterns/Advanced Usage
* **Elevation Control:** Demonstrating different `elevation` values (0-24) to show varying shadow depths.
* **Outlined Variant:** Using `variant="outlined"` for a flat appearance with a border.
* **Square Corners:** Using the `square` prop to remove rounded corners.
* **Dark Mode Behavior:** In dark mode, increasing the elevation also makes the background color lighter by applying a semi-transparent gradient.
* **Card-like Structures:** `Paper` is often a fundamental building block for components like `Card`.
* **Custom Component Root:** Using the `component` prop to render `Paper` as a different HTML element.

### 1.7. Accessibility (A11y)
* As a generic container, `Paper` itself doesn't have specific ARIA roles by default.
* If `Paper` is used to group related content that forms a semantic section, consider using the `component` prop to render it as a more semantic HTML element or add appropriate ARIA roles and labels.
* Ensure content within the `Paper` follows accessibility best practices.

### 1.8. Styling/Customization
* Using the `sx` prop for instance-specific overrides.
* Using the `styled()` utility for creating reusable custom `Paper` components.
* Theme customization for global `Paper` styles via `styleOverrides` in `MuiPaper`.
* CSS global class names.
