  You can remove most of the styles from this file if you are
  primarily using Tailwind CSS for styling.

  The #root styles here were conflicting with index.css.
  It's generally better to manage global layout from index.css
  or directly within your App.jsx component using Tailwind classes.

/* Example: If you had very specific component styles that are hard to do with Tailwind,
   they could live here, but try to minimize global overrides. */
